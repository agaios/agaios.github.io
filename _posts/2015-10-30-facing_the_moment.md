Usually when I think of an action in time or periods of time in life,  
the judgement is that, I could have handle differently my participation  
in the history that was written and can not be repeated. 

At the judgement moment, we are (usually) pretty certain by that.  
Of course is the experience you've gained by living that leads you to  
that confidence feeling. Time is passing and you have to "seize the day"  
because that day can not be repeated.

I wish I could face the moment, with the vibration of the future judgement  
moment of the current moment.

Some call the moment, as a "slow train is comming" or "a buffalo herd runing  
in a valley over an ant colony".

Hey ant, you have to face the buffalo!
