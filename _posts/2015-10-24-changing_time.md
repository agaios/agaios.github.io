Let's go back (in future). Just a bit. Just a hour. Like the clocks.

Use the past achievments, to go back in time. When we used to use hands.  
Use the technology to go back in time. To be able to do things with hands.

We owe to our species to feel the joy of: that when doing things by hands,  
are more than enough to evolve your human, to make your living by minimum  
physical effort that makes you stronger, to enjoy the process and the  
progress - all of them at the same time. To save (in history) the time,  
of the past bit of the (current) human definition of time, which the joy  
suddenly lost, as the required step in earth human history, to re-evaluate  
priotities and gain that bit of the consience need, that is needed to let  
the human decide and understand.

To speed that bit of tomorrow, we can also use clocks to do things like:

The light of the night can come at the same time at winter and at the summer.  
Say seven.  
And changed after some time to ten, and then 2 two, and then maybe will see  
the time as space.

I really want to be in (that) time. Praying.

(for Georgia that is having her time today, and I'm not there)
