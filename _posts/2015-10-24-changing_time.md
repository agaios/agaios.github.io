Let's go back (in future). Just a bit. Just a hour. Like the clocks.

Use the past achievments, to go back in time. When we used to use hands.  
Use the technology to go back in time. To be able to do things with hands.

We owe to our species to feel the joy of: that when doing things by hands,  
are more than enough to evolve your human, to make your living by minimum  
physical effort that makes you stronger, to enjoy the process and the  
progress - all of them at the same time. To save (in history) the time,  
of the past bit of the (current) human definition of time, which the joy  
suddenly lost, as the required step in earth human history, to re-evaluate  
priotities and gain that bit of the consience need, that is needed to let  
the human decide and understand.

To speed that bit of tomorrow, we can also use clocks to do things like:

The light of the night can come at the same time at winter and at the summer.  
Say seven.  
And changed after some time to ten, and then 2 two, and then maybe will see  
the time as space.

I really want to be in (that) time. Praying.

(for Georgia that is having her time today, and I'm not there)

first edition:
oh... and the time at github is specified differently than my time.  
A couple of hours back. Just a bit.

I think I will provide my own time from now and on.  
The (good?) thing about git managment is that you can go past in time   
and change your (static?) sayings and evolve them (or worse?) and nobody  
notices.  
Unless you clone this site and issue:

`git log -p`

then you are in history. Just in front of you.  The back of you.

I think I will name that post differently. I'll put the this header at  
the end.

## evolving by revolving around time ... ##

and here is my time: 2015-10-24 23:59:16

You see, is almost midnight. We are in the middle. Before the mid is the  
past. After mid is the feature. So mid is at now. But now is gone.  
So is it possible to save the history (before the mid) as a proud time
of ours?

And for last but not least.  
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
[what a coincidence? (see comments) Zero hour or midnight?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vHvzybkqfo)

The time is finishing. Some minutes left ...
And again we'll go back in time. One hour. Ok technically the clocks are  
changing at 4. But symbolically after 2 minutes (human specified time sense).

end...
... almost.
